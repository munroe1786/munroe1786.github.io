My final Flatiron project is called Art Locale.  It's a React-Redux app with a Rails API as the backend. It allows you to add an artist to the application and then add museums that display that artist's work.

The relationships are that an Artist has many Museums and a Museum belongs to an Artist.

I wanted to keep this app simple, so there is not a user model at this time.  I thought that was best for me so that I could really understand what I was building.  Images are something that I would like to add eventually and I am working on learning that for future projects.  I may go back and add images to this project, but for now, it functions as a way to see at a glance where an artist's work is displayed around the world.

Routing was very important in this app and I feel like that was one of my biggest challenges.  The Redux flow was also tricky to learn.  I'm definitely going to draw some of my own diagrams before the assessment to be more sure of my understanding.  

My time at Flatiron has been so challenging and so very rewarding at the same time.  It's been a great experience and I feel so fortunate to have been a part of it.
