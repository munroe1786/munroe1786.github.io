I've been thinking and talking about enrolling in a coding bootcamp for several years now.  Just ask my family or close friends.  I solicited the advice of one of those friends, as he works as a high level tech guru for a startup.  He passed along great tips and some solid wisdom that I found very helpful.  So helpful, I printed out the email and kept it in my purse for almost 3 years.  I would sometimes read it on breaks at work or look up some schools on the list he gave me.

My liberal arts degrees allowed me to obtain a job as a tiny cog in a giant corporate machine.  There, any degree is treated with reverence.  Never mind the fact that I eventually was painted into a corner growth wise and even had a manager tell me point blank "I want to keep you where you are".  I did the tasks assigned to me as well as I could given the environment  in the office and from the field personnel.  

My work consisted of processing orders and pricing requests for very complicated window and door systems.  It was the type of work that only a few people there understood and most people didn't want to understand it.  I didn't think it was that difficult, but I am very stubborn and may have just insisted on understanding a bit more that most of my coworkers.

I think working in that office is where I first started thinking about a career in coding.  I was always the one in the family to handle technological items.  My dad would get us a new vcr and I would be the one to hook it up and program it (yes, I'm giving my age away here).  

When I worked for the giant corporation, I worked on several different data entry systems.  I know I was working with the consumer side and that they were configured for my ease whenever possible, but I would catch glimpses behind the scenes once in a while if things did not go right.  It made me wonder about all the work that went into those systems and how it was a type of magic that made them work.  I thought it would be interesting to learn what I could about that magic and apply it to a new career and in turn enjoy a better life.

One where hopefully no one will ever tell me "I want to keep you where you are".
