I am finishing up my first Flatiron portfolio project, a CLI Gem.  Overall, I learned a lot from this project.  There were definitely obstacles and times where I was not sure if I could complete such a big task, but looking back on it, I am proud of what I built.

I worked with the Studio Ghibli public API using the Films endpoint.  It was unlike other APIs that I have seen, which, admittedly, are few in number.  This API seemed to have other endpoints embedded within the Films emdpoint.  Because of that, I was a little limited in the data I could access at my current skill level.  Hopefully I can use this API again for a future project and access some of the other data.

My CLI section was the largest in my project.  It handled a small menu that called on methods to display a numbered list of all the films and then an option to read the description for a selected film.

The other menu option provided the same list of films, but displayed the director, producer and release date of the selected film.  

Within the second menu option, the user could opt to see the Rotten Tomatoes scores of all the films in a list.  I wanted to add an option that offered another level of access.  

I feel like I learned a lot working on this project.  Writing code from the ground up was a bit intimidating, but the video resources available were very helpful in getting the gem installed and set up so that I could start building the methods.  There are a lot of video walkthroughs of CLI Gems and these were extremely helpful.

I also learned to reach out for help, something that is hard for me at times.  But we are all here to help each other learn, succeed and grow.

So now I am going to prepare for the project review by making sure I understand all the mechanics of the gem and its file structures.  I also want to review OOP so that I am able to discuss it confidently.
