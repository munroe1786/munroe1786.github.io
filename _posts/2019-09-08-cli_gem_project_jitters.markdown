So I have a week left to finish my first Flatiron project and I have a pretty bad case of the jitters.   I've watched several videos about how to set up a gem and how to work through the different classes in the program, but right now I am nervous about the actual coding work that needs to be done.

The few steps I have taken have resulted in slowdowns or outright disaster in one case.  I have learned that I should not attempt a new and critically important step in the gem setting up process while somewhat sleepy.  So that is a good thing to learn - slow down, make sure I am following the correct steps and be conscientious always.  I also learned that even if I break something badly, it can most likely be fixed or erased and started over.

The gem I am going to be working on pulls data from the Studio Ghibli Films public API.  I love Studio Ghibli and I think I can get some interesting information for the user from the API.  Ideally, I would jazz it up a bit with a colorize Gem and possibly a quote of the day function.

I chose this subject for this project because I think I can expland upon it for future projects, especially ones that work with visual elements.  My background is in Art History and Anthropology, so originally I wanted to use the Harvard Art Museum API, but it is massive and would be tricky to crack open, at least where I am currently knowledge-wise.

So for today, I am going to dive into the coding and work on one step at a time, make changes where the code dictates and lean on the resources available to me.  The jitters should fade away once I make some progress.

I just need to tap into the gritty resourcefulness I know I possess and things will get better!
